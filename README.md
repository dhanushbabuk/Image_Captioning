# Image Captioning With LSTM And Vanilla RNN

## Introduction

This project demonstrates image captioning using two different types of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Vanilla RNN. Image captioning involves generating a textual description for a given image, a complex task that requires understanding both the content of the image and generating coherent text.
