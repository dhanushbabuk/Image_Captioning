Image Captioning With LSTM And Vanilla RNN
Introduction
This project demonstrates image captioning using two different types of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Vanilla RNN. Image captioning involves generating a textual description for a given image, a complex task that requires understanding both the content of the image and generating coherent text.

Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-captioning-lstm-rnn.git
cd image-captioning-lstm-rnn
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the necessary datasets and pre-trained models. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and storage.

Usage
To run the image captioning models, follow these instructions:

Open the Jupyter notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook Image\ Captioning\ With\ LSTM\ And\ Vanilla\ RNN.ipynb
Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess data, train the models, and generate captions.

Examples
Here are a few examples of image captioning using the models trained in this project:

Input Image:

Generated Caption (LSTM): "A cat sitting on a window sill."

Generated Caption (Vanilla RNN): "A cat is sitting near a window."

Input Image:

Generated Caption (LSTM): "A group of people standing on the beach."

Generated Caption (Vanilla RNN): "People are standing on the beach."

Model Architecture
LSTM Model
The LSTM model is designed to capture long-term dependencies in the sequence of words generated for the image. It consists of:

An encoder that processes the input image using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) like ResNet or Inception.
A decoder that uses LSTM units to generate the sequence of words (captions).
Vanilla RNN Model
The Vanilla RNN model uses simpler RNN units without the gating mechanisms of LSTM. It includes:

A similar CNN-based encoder for image feature extraction.
A standard RNN-based decoder for caption generation.
Dataset
The models are trained on the COCO dataset, which contains a large collection of images with corresponding captions. Ensure you have downloaded and preprocessed the dataset as per the instructions in the notebook.

Training
To train the models, run the relevant sections in the Jupyter notebook. Adjust the hyperparameters as needed:

Learning rate
Batch size
Number of epochs
Evaluation
After training, evaluate the models using metrics like BLEU score to assess the quality of the generated captions.

Results
Summarize the key results and compare the performance of LSTM and Vanilla RNN models based on the evaluation metrics.
